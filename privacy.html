  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the 63-day challenge app ("the App") handles user information.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App itself does not require users to provide personal information such as name, address, or phone number.
    User-generated data (such as goals, progress, or notes) is stored locally on the user’s device.
  </p>

  <h2>Cloud Backup and Authentication</h2>
  <p>
    If you choose to enable backup, restore, or cloud-based features, the App may use third-party services
    such as Firebase for authentication and data storage. In this case, data is handled in accordance with
    the privacy policies of those services.
  </p>

  <h2>AI Features</h2>
  <p>
    The App may offer optional AI-powered features. Text or data submitted by the user for these features
    is sent to external AI services solely for processing and generating responses.
    This data is not used by the developer for advertising purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>
    The App may offer optional paid subscriptions. All payments and billing information are processed
    by the App Store. The developer does not collect or store payment information.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties, except as necessary to
    provide app functionality through trusted services such as Firebase or AI providers.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not specifically directed toward children under the age of 13.
    No knowing collection of personal information from children is intended.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Reasonable measures are taken to protect user data. However, no method of electronic storage
    or transmission is completely secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
  </p>
